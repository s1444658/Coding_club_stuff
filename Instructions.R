# Challenge 1: Slope estimates for each biome ----
# Make histograms of slope estimates for each biome and save them in a folder called Biome_LPI

# HINTS:
# You need to make the folder where you save the files first
# You can use dplyr to group by biome and run simple linear models (e.g. population size through time)
# With broom you can get a dataframe with model outputs
# Use do() before a function call within a pipe to make the function run for all groupings in the pipe

# Challenge 2: Slope estimates and SE vs study duration + marginal histograms ----
# Make a scatterplot of slope estimates and standard errors for all populations vs study duration
# Add histograms of slope estimates and study duration along the margins of the plots
# Save your graph in the github-practice folder

# HINTS:
# You can use the package ggExtra to easily make marginal histograms for ggplot2 objects

# Challenge 3: Histograms for each system type (freshwater, marine, terrestrial) ----
# Make a three panel figure that includes a histogram of slope estimates for each system type
# Save your figure in the github-practice folder

# HINTS:
# The object we made of model outputs (LPI.models) doesn't include the system column
# Bring it back and then you can easily filter by system type and make the histograms

# Challenge 4: Population change in mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles ----
# Make a four panel figure of scatterplots for the different animal classes
# Slope estimates and SE vs study duration + marginal histograms
# Add animal silhouettes in the top right corner as a legend
# (if you like that sort of stuff)
# Save your panel in the github-practice folder

# HINTS:

# The object we made of model outputs (LPI.models) doesn't include the class column
# Bring it back and then you can easily filter by class and make the scatterplots

# Use the package ggExtra for the marginal histograms

# You can find the animal images in the repo along with the data
# Use the packages png and grid to get the images into a format R recognises
# The functions for that are readPNG() and rasterGrob()
